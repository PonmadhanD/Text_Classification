# Text_Classification
This project demonstrates an end-to-end automated machine learning workflow for classifying text data. Using the Auto_ViML library, it automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, drastically reducing the need for manual intervention while maintaining high accuracy.
